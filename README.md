# Merchant AI

## What

I'm working on putting together an AI agent that's all about understanding and reacting to coloring book trends, an insane online market! Imagine having a smart assistant that not only figures out what people are into but also designs books to match those interests and learns from the sales results to do better each time.

## Here’s the Plan:

### **Data Collection**

- **Goal**: Grab data from all over — social media, Google Trends, you name it.
- **How**: By hooking into APIs and doing some clever web scraping.

### **Trend Analysis**

- **Goal**: Sift through the data to catch the latest trends.
- **How**: With some sharp machine learning models and serious number crunching.

### **Product Development**

- **Goal**: Take those trends and turn them into books that people want to read.
- **How**: Using automated tools to design and fill out the pages.

### **Feedback Loop**

- **Goal**: Learn from each launch to make the next one even better.
- **How**: By adjusting tactics based on sales data and customer feedback.

### **Marketing and Sales**

- **Goal**: Get those books out there and make some sales.
- **How**: With automated marketing and smart e-commerce strategies.

## So, What’s the Real Deal?

This is what I'm aiming to build. It's about making an Autonomous AI that doesn't just help publish books but does so in a way that's always one step ahead, thanks to real smarts and real data. Stay tuned to see how it turns out!

It's an entire fricken publishing house!!
